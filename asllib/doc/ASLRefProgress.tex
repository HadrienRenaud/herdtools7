\chapter{Not implemented in ASLRef}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter describes what is not yet present in the executable version of ASLRef
versus the LRM (Build \#215 from Feb 22, 2024).

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Syntax}

\subsection{Pragmas}
ASLRef does not currently parse pragmas:
\begin{verbatim}
pragma asl_pragma1;
\end{verbatim}

This is related to \identi{ZGJQ}, \identr{GBNH}, \identr{GFSD}.

\subsection{Declaring Multiple Identifiers with No Initialization}
The following simultaneous declaration of three global variables does not currently parse with ASLRef.
\begin{verbatim}
 var x, y, z : integer;
\end{verbatim}

The same line does parse and correctly handled inside a subprogram.

This is related to \identr{QDQD}.

\subsection{Annotations}
ASLRef does not yet support annotations.
Specifically loop limit and recursion limit annotations are not yet supported.

\subsection{Recursion Limits}
ASLRef does not yet parse and support \texttt{@recurselimit(<LIMIT>)} annotations.

\subsection{Concatenation Declarations}
Declarations of multiple bitvectors via concatenation as in the program
\begin{Verbatim}
func main() => integer
begin
    var [ a[7:0], b, c[3:0] ] = Zeros(13);
    return 0;
end
\end{Verbatim}
do not currently parse.

This is related to \identr{KKDF}.

\subsection{Guards}

Guards are used on \texttt{case} and \texttt{catch} statements, to restrict
matching on the evaluation of a boolean expression.
%
They are not yet implemented in ASLRef.

This relates to \identr{WGSY}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Typing}

\subsection{Checking that All Paths in a Function Return a Value}
The following function currently passes type-checking even though
it does not return a value when \texttt{a <= 7}.
\begin{verbatim}
func foo(a : integer) => integer
begin
  if (a > 7) then
    return 0;
  end
end
\end{verbatim}
This requires a control-flow analysis.

A call to \texttt{Unreachable} needs to indicate to the control-flow
analysis that it is okay for the \texttt{else} path to not return a value.
\begin{verbatim}
func foo(a : integer) => integer
begin
  if (a > 7) then
    return 0;
  else
    Unreachable();
  end
end
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Side-effect-free Subprograms}
ASLRef does yet infer whether a subprorgam is side-effect-free.
Therefore, there are no checks that expressions are side-effect-free when those are expected,
for example, in \texttt{for} loop ranges.

This is related to \identr{WQRN}, \identr{SNQJ}, \identr{DJMC}, \identr{KLDR}.

\subsection{Statically evaluable programs}%
\label{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}

Side effects analysis has not been implemented yet.
%
This makes detection of statically evaluable subprograms impossible.

Furthermore, non-execution time subprograms, expressions, and types have not
been implemented.

This is related to \identi{LZCX}, \identi{NXJR}, \identr{CSFT}, \identi{HYBT},
\identd{CCTY}, \identi{LYKD}, \identi{ZPWM}, \identd{KCKX}, \identi{NTYZ},
\identi{MSZT}, \identd{QNHM}, \identi{XYKC}, \identd{ZPMF}, \identi{XSDY},
\identd{XRBT}, \identi{WVGG}, \identd{JLJD}, \identi{KKDY}, \identd{MTQJ},
\identi{YBGL}, \identi{YMRT}, \identi{QJTN}, \identi{GFZT}.

\subsection{Restriction on use of under-constrained types}

\subsubsection{As storage types}
Restrictions on use of under-constrained types as storage element types are not
implemented.

This is related to \identr{ZCVD}.

\subsubsection{As expression with a constrained type}

Restriction on the use of under-constrained parameters as left-hand-side of a
Asserted Typed Conversion is not implemented in ASLRef.
%
For example, the following will not raise a type-error:
\VerbatimInput[firstline=3,lastline=8]{../tests/regressions.t/under-constrained-used.asl}

This is related to \identi{TBHH}, \identr{ZDKC}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Semantics}

\subsection{Non-\texttt{main} Entry Point}
Currently ASLRef only supports \texttt{main} as an entry point.

\subsection{Real exponentiation}

The exponentiation operation \texttt{exp\_real} has not been implemented.
%
Note: this would construct non-rational numbers which are not supported by
ASLRef, e.\,g.\ $2^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{2}$.

This is related to \identr{BNCY}.

\section{Typing}

\subsection{Global storage declarations}

Global storage declarations are transliterated.
The formal rules need a bit more refinement (e.g., defining \texttt{declare\_const} and \texttt{reduce\_constants}).

This is related to \identr{FWQM}.

\subsection{Statically evaluable expressions}

The part of statically evaluable expressions that has been implemented in
ASLRef (see Section~\ref{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}) has not
been transliterated.

Equivalence of statically evaluable expressions has been implemented in a
restricted setting (see
Section~\ref{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}).
%
Mainly, expressions that reduce to polynomials can be checked for equivalence.
%
This has not been transliterated either.

This is related to \identr{PKXK}, \identd{YYDW}, \identd{CWVH}, \identd{HLQC},
and \identi{LHLR}, \identr{RFQP}, \identr{VNKT}.

\subsection{Polymorphism}

Polymorphism in ASL is the ability to have multiple subprograms with the same
name that do not have the same signature.

Although polymorphism is implemented in ASLRef, it has not yet been
transliterated.

This is related to \identd{BTBR}, \identi{FSFQ}, \identi{FCTB}, \identi{PFGQ},
\identr{PGFC}, \identi{BTMT}.

\subsection{Calls to setters and getters}

The replacement of implicit calls to getters and setters (written for example as
slices) to explicit calls to subprograms has not been transliterated.
%
In terms of abstract syntax, this corresponds to the translation between a
\texttt{E\_Slice} and a \texttt{E\_Call}.

This is related to \identi{YYQX}, \identi{LJLW}, \identi{MFBC}.

\subsection{Type inference from literals}

Finding the type of a literal value, or a compile-time constant expression, is
not yet transliterated.

This is related to \identr{ZJKY} and \identi{RYRP}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Semantics}

\subsection{Base values of types}

Finding the base value of a type is not transliterated.

This is related to \identr{NJDZ}, \identr{CFTD}, \identr{QGGH}, \identi{WVQZ},
\identr{GYCG}, \identr{WKCY}, \identr{LCCN}, \identr{CPCK}, \identr{ZVPT},
\identi{QFZH}, \identr{ZGVR}, \identi{PGSS}, \identr{QWSQ}, \identr{HMRK},
\identr{MBRM}, \identr{SVJB}.

\subsection{Operations}

Operations are not transliterated from ASLRef.

This is related to \identr{NCWM}, \identr{VGZF}, \identr{THSV}, \identr{CRQJ},
\identr{ZTJN}, \identr{SVMM}, \identr{WWTV}, \identr{GHXR}, \identi{NBCT}.

\subsection{Standard library and primitives}

The standard library is not transliterated.

This is related to \identr{RXYN}.

\section{Side-Effects}

Side-Effects are not yet considered in ASLRef.

\section{In scope for BET1}

Need to populate - for example Side-Effects should be there, as well as some
work on constraints.
Generally we need to review this Progress document and update it.
