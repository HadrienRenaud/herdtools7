\chapter{Not Implemented by ASLRef\label{appendix:UnimplementedInASLRef}}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter describes what is not yet present in the executable version of ASLRef
(Build \#215 from Feb 22, 2024).

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Syntax}

\subsection{Reserved Keyword}
\texttt{pattern} should be a reserved keyword.

\subsection{Pragmas}
ASLRef does not currently parse pragmas:
\begin{verbatim}
pragma asl_pragma1;
\end{verbatim}

\lrmcomment{This is related to \identi{ZGJQ}, \identr{GBNH}, \identr{GFSD}.}

\subsection{Declaring Multiple Identifiers Without Initialization}
The following simultaneous declaration of three global variables does not currently parse with ASLRef.
\begin{verbatim}
 var x, y, z : integer;
\end{verbatim}

The same line does parse and correctly handled inside a subprogram.

\lrmcomment{This is related to \identr{QDQD}.}

\subsection{Annotations}
ASLRef does not yet support annotations in general.
Loop limit annotations are supported, but recursion limit annotations are not yet supported.

\subsection{Recursion Limits}
ASLRef does not yet parse and support \texttt{@recurselimit(<LIMIT>)} annotations.

\subsection{Concatenation Declarations}
Declarations of multiple bitvectors via concatenation as in the program
\begin{Verbatim}
func main() => integer
begin
    var [ a[7:0], b, c[3:0] ] = Zeros(13);
    return 0;
end
\end{Verbatim}
do not currently parse.

\lrmcomment{This is related to \identr{KKDF}.}

\subsection{Guards}

Guards are used on \texttt{case} and \texttt{catch} statements, to restrict
matching on the evaluation of a boolean expression.
%
They are not yet implemented in ASLRef.

\lrmcomment{This relates to \identr{WGSY}.}

\subsection{Catching Operator Precedence Errors}
ASLRef does not yet catch the following types of errors nor are they defined in the syntax reference.

Operator precedence is used to disambiguate binary expressions.

Given two binary operators op1 and op2, an expression of the form x op1 y op2 z, is interpreted as (x op1 y) op2 z
if op1 has higher precedence than op2 or as x op1 (y op2 z) if op1 has lower precedence than op2 . If op1 is
associative and op1 = op2 then the expression may be interpreted as either (x op1 y) op2 z or as x op1 (y op2 z)
since there is no difference. Otherwise it is a static operator precedence error.

The following operators are associative: \texttt{+} \texttt{*} \texttt{\&\&} \texttt{||} \texttt{AND} \texttt{OR} \texttt{X}OR

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  \hline
Precedence Class Operators\\
\hline
1 (Highest) & Membership & \texttt{IN}\\
2 & Unary & \texttt{-} \texttt{!} \texttt{NOT}\\
3 & Power & \textasciicircum\\
4 & Mul-Div-Shift & \texttt{*} \texttt{/} \texttt{DIV} \texttt{DIVRM} \texttt{MOD} \texttt{<<} \texttt{>>}\\
5 & Add-Sub-Logic & \texttt{+} \texttt{-} \texttt{AND} \texttt{OR} \texttt{XOR}\\
6 & Comparison & \texttt{==} \texttt{!=} \texttt{>} \texttt{>=} \texttt{<} \texttt{<=}\\
7 & (Lowest) Boolean & \&\& \texttt{||} \texttt{-->} \texttt{<->}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Semantics}

\subsection{Enforcing Loop Limits}
\verb|@looplimit| annotations are type-checked but not enforced for \texttt{while} and \texttt{repeat} loops.

\subsection{Non-\texttt{main} Entry Point}
Currently ASLRef only supports \texttt{main} as an entry point.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Typing}

\subsection{Throwing Exceptions without Braces}
In the following example, the commented out \texttt{throw} statement should type-check,
but it currently fails.

\begin{verbatim}
  type except of exception;

  func main() => integer
  begin
    // throw except; // Should type-check
    throw except{}; // Okay

    return 0;
  end
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Checking that All Paths in a Function Return a Value}
The following function currently passes type-checking even though
it does not return a value when \texttt{a <= 7}.
\begin{verbatim}
func foo(a : integer) => integer
begin
  if (a > 7) then
    return 0;
  end
end
\end{verbatim}
This requires a control-flow analysis.

A call to \texttt{Unreachable} needs to indicate to the control-flow
analysis that it is okay for the \texttt{else} path to not return a value.
\begin{verbatim}
func foo(a : integer) => integer
begin
  if (a > 7) then
    return 0;
  else
    Unreachable();
  end
end
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Side-effect-free Subprograms}
ASLRef does yet infer whether a subprorgam is side-effect-free.
Therefore, there are no checks that expressions are side-effect-free when those are expected,
for example, in \texttt{for} loop ranges.

\lrmcomment{This is related to \identr{WQRN}, \identr{SNQJ}, \identr{DJMC}, \identr{KLDR}.}

\subsection{Statically evaluable programs}%
\label{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}

Side effects analysis has not been implemented yet.
%
This makes detection of statically evaluable subprograms impossible.

Furthermore, non-execution time subprograms, expressions, and types have not
been implemented.

\lrmcomment{This is related to \identi{LZCX}, \identi{NXJR}, \identr{CSFT}, \identi{HYBT},

\identd{XRBT}, \identi{WVGG}, \identd{JLJD}, \identi{KKDY}, \identd{MTQJ},
\identi{YBGL}, \identi{YMRT}, \identi{QJTN}, \identi{GFZT}.}

\subsection{Restriction on Use of Parameterized Integer Types}

\subsubsection{As storage types}
Restrictions on the use of parameterized integer types as storage element types are not
implemented.

\lrmcomment{This is related to \identr{ZCVD}.}

\subsubsection{\texttt{as} Expression With a Constrained Type}

Restriction on the use of parameterized integer types as left-hand-side of a
Asserted Typed Conversion is not implemented in ASLRef.
%
For example, the following will not raise a type-error:
\VerbatimInput[firstline=1,lastline=4]{../tests/regressions.t/under-constrained-used.asl}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Typing}

\subsection{Checking Type Annotations for Absence of Side Effects}
Type annotations that contain expressions must ensure that those expressions are side-effect-free.
This is currently ensured by disallowing such expressions to contain call expressions.
Allowing side-effect-free calls is being considered.

\subsection{Enumeration Labels}
Enumeration labels are not yet treated as first-class literals, but rather as integer literals.
The domain of an enumeration type should be a set of enumeration labels.

% \subsection{Global storage declarations}
% Global storage declarations are transliterated.
% The formal rules need a bit more refinement (e.g., defining \texttt{declare\_const} and \texttt{reduce\_constants}).
% \lrmcomment{This is related to \identr{FWQM}.}

% \subsection{Statically evaluable expressions}

% The part of statically evaluable expressions that has been implemented in
% ASLRef (see Section~\ref{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}) has not
% been transliterated.

% Equivalence of statically evaluable expressions has been implemented in a
% restricted setting (see
% Section~\ref{sec:nyi:statically-evaluable-subprograms}).
% %
% Mainly, expressions that reduce to polynomials can be checked for equivalence.
% %
% This has not been transliterated either.

% \lrmcomment{This is related to \identr{PKXK}, \identd{YYDW}, \identd{CWVH}, \identd{HLQC},
% and \identi{LHLR}, \identr{RFQP}, \identr{VNKT}.}

% \subsection{Polymorphism}

% Polymorphism in ASL is the ability to have multiple subprograms with the same
% name that do not have the same signature.

% Although polymorphism is implemented in ASLRef, it has not yet been
% transliterated.

% \lrmcomment{This is related to \identd{BTBR}, \identi{FSFQ}, \identi{FCTB}, \identi{PFGQ},
% \identr{PGFC}, \identi{BTMT}.}

\subsection{Calls to Setters and Getters}
The replacement of implicit calls to getters and setters (written for example as
slices) to explicit calls to subprograms has not been defined.
%
In terms of abstract syntax, this corresponds to the translation between a
\texttt{E\_Slice} and a \texttt{E\_Call}.

\lrmcomment{This is related to \identi{YYQX}, \identi{LJLW}, \identi{MFBC}.}

% \subsection{Type inference from literals}
% Finding the type of a literal value, or a compile-time constant expression, is
% not yet transliterated.

% \lrmcomment{This is related to \identr{ZJKY} and \identi{RYRP}.}

\section{Side-Effects}

Side-Effects are not yet defined by the reference.

% \section{In scope for BET1}

% Need to populate - for example Side-Effects should be there, as well as some
% work on constraints.
% Generally we need to review this Progress document and update it.
