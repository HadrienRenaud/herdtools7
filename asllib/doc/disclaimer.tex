\chapter{Disclaimer}

This document is part of the ASLRef material.

This material covers ASLv1, a new, experimental, and as yet unreleased version of ASL.

The development version of ASLRef can be found here: \\
\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7}.

A list of open items being worked on can be found here: \\
\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/blob/master/asllib/doc/ASLRefProgress.tex}.

This material is work in progress, more precisely at Alpha quality as
per Arm’s quality standards. In particular, this means that it would be
premature to base any production tool development on this material.

However, any feedback, question, query and feature request would be most
welcome; those can be sent to Arm’s Architecture Formal Team Lead Jade Alglave
\texttt{(jade.alglave@arm.com)} or by raising issues or PRs to the herdtools7
github repository.
