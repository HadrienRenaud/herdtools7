\chapter{Introduction\label{chap:Introduction}}

This reference defines Arm’s Architecture Specification Language (ASL), which is the language
used in Arm’s architecture reference manuals to describe the Arm architecture.

ASL is designed and used to specify architectures. As a specification language, it is designed to be accessible,
understandable, and unambiguous to programmers, hardware
engineers, and hardware verification engineers, who collectively have quite a small intersection of languages they
all understand. It can intentionally under specify behaviors in the architecture being described.

ASL is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a first-order language with strong static type-checking.
    \item whitespace-insensitive.
    \item imperative.
\end{itemize}

ASL has support for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item bitvectors:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item as a type.
        \item as a literal constant.
        \item bitvector concatenation.
        \item bitvector constants with wildcards.
        \item bitslices.
        \item dependent types to support function overloading using bitvector lengths.
        \item dependent types to reason about lengths of bitvectors.
    \end{itemize}
    \item unbounded arithmetic types “integer” and “real”.
    \item exceptions.
    \item enumerations.
    \item arrays.
    \item records.
    \item call-by-value.
    \item type inference.
\end{itemize}

ASL does not have support for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item references or pointers.
    \item macros.
    \item templates.
    \item virtual functions.
\end{itemize}

A \emph{specification} consists of a self-contained collection of ASL code.

More specifically, a specification is the set of declarations written in ASL code which describe an architecture.

\section{Example Specification 1}
\listingref{spec1} shows a small example of a specification written in ASL. It consists of the following declarations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Global bitvectors \texttt{R0}, \texttt{R1}, and \texttt{R2} representing the state of the system.
    \item A function \texttt{MyOR} demonstrating a simple bit-wise OR function of 2 bitvectors.
    \item Initialization of \texttt{R0} and \texttt{R1} bitvectors.
    \item Assignment of bitvector \texttt{R2} with the result of a function call.
\end{itemize}

\section{Example Specification 2}
\listingref{spec2} shows a small example of a specification written in ASL. It consists of the following declarations:
\begin{itemize}
\item A global variable \texttt{COUNT} representing the state of the system.
\item A procedure \texttt{ColdReset} to initialize the state of the system when power is applied and the system is reset.
    This interpretation of the function is a convention used in this particular specification. It is up to each
    specification to decide the role of each function.
\item A procedure \texttt{Step} to advance the state of the system. That is, it defines the \emph{transition relation} of the system.
    Again, this interpretation is a convention used in this particular specification, not part of the ASL language
    itself.
\end{itemize}

\section{Example Specification 3}
\listingref{spec3} shows a small example of a specification in ASL. It consists of the following declarations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A function \texttt{Dot8} which operates on 2 bitvectors a byte at a time.
    \item A global variable \texttt{COUNT} to indicate the number of calls to the \texttt{Fib} function.
    \item A function \texttt{Fib} demonstrating recursion with a bound of 1000 on its depth.
    \item Assignment of a global bitvector \texttt{X} with a call to the \texttt{Dot8} function.
    \item Assignment of a variable from the result of a call to the recursive function \texttt{Fib}.
    \item A function \texttt{main}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Structure of this Reference:}
The rest of this document introduces elements of the ASL language and formalizes
them. First, the mathematical background needed to understand the formalization
is introduced in \chapref{FormalSystem}.
Then, we define the ASL lexical structure \chapref{LexicalStructure}, syntax \chapref{Syntax},
and abstract syntax (AST) \chapref{AbstractSyntax}.
Familiarity with the AST is \underline{essential} for understanding the
type system (static semantics) and the dynamic semantics.
\chapref{TypeChecking}, and \chapref{Semantics} introduce the
definitions used to formalize the type system and dynamic semantics.
Following these chapters, the reference roughly follows the structure of the AST
in a bottom-up fashion, until reaching \chapref{TopLevel} where all of the formalisms
are used together to demonstrate how they can be utilized to form an interpreter
for an ASL specification.
